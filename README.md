Clone this repo to your local machine.

*Note: if you don't have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, you will need to do that before following these steps!*

**npm:**
```
npm install
```

**Parcel JS:**
To run Parcel, on your command line, use this command:
```
parcel {path}/index.html
```
This will build your project, and start a local dev server at http://localhost:1234/. The cool part about this is that anytime you make changes to your files, Parcel will automatically rebuild and update the local site for you.
