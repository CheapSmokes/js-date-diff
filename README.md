# Setup for development 

Clone this repo to your local machine.

*Note: if you don't have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, you will need to do that before following these steps!*

**npm:**
```
npm install
```

**Parcel JS:**
To run Parcel, on your command line, use this command:
```
npm start
```
This will build your project, and start a local dev server at http://localhost:1234/. The cool part about this is that anytime you make changes to your files, Parcel will automatically rebuild and update the local site for you.


**Testing:**
```
npm test
```
Testing Jest out on this project because that's what the guys use at their workplace. 
**May not work on some machines with the current NPM package setup. Needs to be fixed to work everywhere.**

# Deployment (Advanced users only)
Compiling the project for deployment is easy. Run the following command from your terminal.

**Terminal:**
```
npm build
```
No steps required for deployment on this project.
